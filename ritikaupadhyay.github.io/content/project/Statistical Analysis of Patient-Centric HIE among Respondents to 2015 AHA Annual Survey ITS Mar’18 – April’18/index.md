Assessment of patient engagement functionalities offered by hospitals across the US per the survey, with a focus on features offered 
to patients to access and manage their health records and the mechanisms available for doing so. <br/><br/>
Some key findings:<br/>
● Government and non-profit hospitals tend to offer their patients more features for managing their healthcare information.<br/>
● The extent to which a hospital shared information with other hospitals & clinics within and outside its network had a significant bearing on the extent of facilities offered.
