The aim here was to better understand how healthcare professionals in India use WhatsApp to communicate with patients and which factors 
set apart those who do from those do do not.<br/>
This study was a step towards a better understanding of benefits, risks and challenges pertaining 
to WhatsApp usage by healthcare professionals in India, leading to better use of such technological tools in healthcare. <br/> <br/>
Some interesting findings: <br/>
