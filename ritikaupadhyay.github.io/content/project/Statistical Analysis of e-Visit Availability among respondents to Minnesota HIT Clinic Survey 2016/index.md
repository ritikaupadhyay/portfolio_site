Used logistic regression to assess which factors distinguish clinics in MN that offer patients e-Visit facilities, and the extent to which they do.<br/>
Some key findings:<br/>
● Primary-care clinics are more likely to offer e-Visits than specialist clinics <br/>
● Facilities that use Epic EHR systems are significantly likely to offer e-Visit facilities <br/>
