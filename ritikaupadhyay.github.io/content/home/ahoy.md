I am a prolific reader and writer <br/>
who loves books and drawing with charcoal;<br/>
I've held a lifelong fascination for good design.<br/>
<br/>

I have a deep interest in philosophy, mental models & cognitive biases.<br/>
{{< figure library="1" src="hagrid.jpg" >}}
I love naps and good food but most of all, my beagle pup Hagrid.
<br/><br/>

I am always working towards being a better version of myself and seek professional and personal relationships that encourage growth.<br/><br/>
I owe much of what I know to those who stand on the shoulders of giants and sift the signal from the noise. <br/>
Here are some newsletters I love. <br/>
